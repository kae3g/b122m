(def ecological-metaphors

   "Just as Helen Atthowe prepares her soil with compost and natural amendments,
    we prepare our development environment with clean tools and dependencies.
    Healthy soil = Healthy codebase foundation."
   
   :seed-selection
   "Like selecting the right seeds for specific soil conditions and climate,
    we choose appropriate technologies and frameworks for our ecosystem.
    Right seeds = Right tools for the job."
   
   :planting-schedule
   "Following seasonal planting schedules ensures optimal growth.
    Our development cycles follow natural rhythms of planning, building,
    testing, and harvesting (deploying)."

   "Certain plants grow better together, supporting each other's growth.
    Our software components work synergistically, each enhancing the others.
    Companion plants = Complementary software modules."
   
   :natural-pest-control
   "Instead of chemical pesticides, Helen uses beneficial insects and
    natural predators. In software, we use automated testing, code reviews,
    and security practices instead of reactive bug fixes."
   
   :crop-rotation
   "Rotating crops prevents soil depletion and breaks pest cycles.
    Rotating our focus between different aspects of development
    prevents burnout and maintains system health."
   
   :harvest-timing
   "Harvesting at the right time ensures maximum nutrition and flavor.
    Deploying at the right time ensures maximum value and minimal risk."

    strong, adapted varieties. Documenting and sharing our best practices
    ensures future generations of strong, adapted software."})
