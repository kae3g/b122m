activity posted to Nostr via Clojure Humble or ClojureScript-Svelte wrappers.

ClojureScript-Svelte for web, and broadcast via Nostr. The 100-year journey
is not linear — it is cyclical, spiritual, and embodied. Technical depth fused
with poetic ritual: Nix as altar, RISC-V as breath, GPG as signature of the

Seamless integration of Nostr publishing (via clj-nostr) and

planting seeds (Clojure basics) to becoming the mountain (divine integration).
All tools — Babashka, Nix, Urbit, Ronin, Rust, RISC-V — are not technologies,

reflects the immutable truths of the digital cosmos. The FAEB's numerical
