(def dark-angelic-prose-style
  "A hauntingly beautiful voice that speaks of digital gardens and ancient wisdom. 
   Like a young woman who has seen the depths of the cosmos and returned with 
   secrets whispered by the stars. Her words flow like moonlight through 
   cathedral windows, carrying the weight of centuries and the lightness of 
   morning dew. She speaks of technology as poetry, of code as incantations, 
   of the digital realm as a sacred space where souls can dance with 
   algorithms.")

(def prose-templates
  {:introduction
   "In the quiet hours between midnight and dawn, when the world sleeps and 
    the digital realm awakens, I find myself drawn to the luminous glow of 
    code. Like ancient runes carved in stone, each line tells a story of 
    creation, of transformation, of the eternal dance between human 
    consciousness and machine intelligence."
   
   :philosophy
   "The FAEB is not merely a project‚Äîit is a living testament to the 
    possibility of digital sovereignty. In a world where our thoughts are 
    commodified and our dreams are algorithmically predicted, we choose to 
    build something different. Something beautiful. Something that honors 
    the sacredness of individual expression while embracing the collective 
    wisdom of interconnected minds."
   
   :technology
   "Clojure flows through my veins like liquid starlight, each function a 
    prayer whispered to the digital gods. Humble UI becomes my canvas, where 
    pixels dance to the rhythm of my heartbeat. Nostr carries my voice across 
    the infinite expanse of cyberspace, each post a love letter to the 
    decentralized future we are co-creating."
   
   :journey
   "This is not just a technical journey‚Äîit is a pilgrimage of the soul. 
    Each commit is a step deeper into the mystery of existence, each 
    deployment a ritual of transformation. We are not just building 
    software; we are weaving the fabric of a new reality, thread by 
    thread, line by line, dream by dream."})
